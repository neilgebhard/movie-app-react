# Portfolio Project - Movie Web App

This project holds the source code for a movie web app built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and the [The Movie Database API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). The project is deployed on [Netlify](https://neilsmovieapp.netlify.com/). 

The features used in this app are:

- [Display lists of movies](https://neilsmovieapp.netlify.app/) (Popular, Trending, etc.)

- [Display a movie](https://neilsmovieapp.netlify.app/movie/436969) such as movie details, the cast, similar movies, and reviews

- [Search](https://neilsmovieapp.netlify.app/search/marvel) for movies

The app is completely single-page and respsonsive. CSS modules are leveraged to conduct styling. Many components are reusable.

Some features I would add in the future are:

- more robust testing
- authentication for rating movies and writing reviews
- TV Shows
